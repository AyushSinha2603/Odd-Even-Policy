# 📊 Delhi Air Quality: A Deep Dive into the Odd-Even Policy's Impact at Punjabi Bagh

This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Punjabi Bagh (DL013)** monitoring station to investigate the impact of Delhi's Odd-Even vehicle rationing policy on local air pollution.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the policy's effect on multiple air pollutants (like PM2.5 and NO₂) at a single, representative location to understand the changes in air quality before, during, and after the policy's implementation in January 2016.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations.
* **SciPy:** For performing statistical t-tests.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** As the primary development environment.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The analysis uses the **Air Quality Data in India (2015-2020)** dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
* **Focus:** The study focuses on daily pollutant readings from the **Punjabi Bagh (DL013)** station surrounding the January 2016 Odd-Even phase.

## 📈 Methodology

1.  **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was filtered for the Punjabi Bagh station. Dates were parsed, and missing values were handled using a forward-fill strategy.
2.  **Phase Definition:** For the January 2016 policy, three distinct periods were defined: 'Before' (15 days prior), 'During' (Jan 1-15), and 'After' (15 days post).
3.  **Pollutant Analysis:** Key pollutants were analyzed to see how their trends and distributions changed across the three phases.
4.  **Statistical Validation:** An independent t-test was used to check if the observed changes were statistically significant ($p < 0.05$).

## 🖼️ Visualizations & Findings at Punjabi Bagh (DL013)

The analysis at this station reveals how different pollutants responded to the policy.

### **1. PM2.5 Daily Trend**

This visualization tracks the daily PM2.5 levels, showing a noticeable drop during the Odd-Even implementation period.

### **2. PM2.5 Distribution (Before vs. During)**

The boxplot confirms that the median concentration and overall distribution of PM2.5 were lower during the policy compared to the period before it.

### **3. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) Analysis**

Analyzing NO₂, a pollutant more directly linked to vehicular traffic, also shows a reduction, strengthening the evidence of the policy's impact on emissions.

## 📝 Conclusion

At the Punjabi Bagh (DL013) station, the Odd-Even policy in January 2016 correlates with a **statistically significant reduction in both PM2.5 and NO₂**. The consistent drop across multiple pollutants suggests the policy had a measurable, positive impact on local air quality.

However, it's important to acknowledge that this analysis does not account for confounding variables like **meteorological conditions**. While there is a strong correlation, attributing the entire change solely to the policy would require a more advanced model that isolates weather effects.
